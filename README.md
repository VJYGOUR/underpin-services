├── components/
│   ├── Carousel.js
│   └── Navbar.js
├── public/

## **Development Approach**

- The login functionality is dummy, with basic validation to check if fields are filled.
- **React state management** is used for handling form inputs and login status.
- For the carousel, the `overflow-x` property and responsive grid layout have been utilized to make the content scrollable horizontally on smaller screens.
- **Tailwind CSS** was used to make the styling as close to the Figma design as possible.

## **Testing**

- The website has been tested on different devices and browsers to ensure proper responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility.
- The design is aligned with the **Figma** specifications.

## **Conclusion**

This project fulfills the assignment’s objective by creating a responsive website based on the given Figma design, using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It includes a dummy login page and a carousel for displaying games, with special attention given to responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility.
